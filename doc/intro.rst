Wish Core
=========

Abstract
--------

A generic peer-to-peer application development framework would enable large 
scale projects without costly investments in infrastructure. Repeatedly 
re-inventing the complicated parts of distributed systems have made them less
attractive to developers, and too big a step for companies developing new
applications. 

We propose a peer-to-peer identity-based network stack called Wish, and provide a reusable application 
library called Wish Core for developing interoperable peer-to-peer applications 
with security and scalability in mind. Connectivity, security and access control 
are part of the specification.

Introduction
------------

Wish Core is a distributed trust-based networking tool for building applications. It 
provides basic functionality to build secure social network structured 
applications without having to re-invent the wheel every time.
